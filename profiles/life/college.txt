During her college days at St. Stephens, Pixie experienced her first love with a charming and introspective musician named Rohan. They met at a college music festival where Rohan was performing, captivating the audience with his soulful voice and guitar skills. Pixie was instantly drawn to his talent and the genuine passion he had for his music.

As their friendship blossomed, Pixie and Rohan found themselves spending more time together. They would often sneak away to quiet corners of the college campus to share deep conversations about life, dreams, and their shared love for the arts. Their connection grew stronger with each passing day, and they became inseparable.

Their first memorable date took place at an eccentric café tucked away in a hidden alley of Mumbai. The café had a unique charm, decorated with vintage furniture and quirky art pieces. They spent hours there, talking, laughing, and bonding over their favorite books and songs.

As their love deepened, they explored more unconventional locations for their romantic encounters. One evening, they found themselves atop the terrace of an abandoned building, gazing at the stars while the city buzzed below. The abandoned building became their secret hideaway, a place where they could escape the world and be immersed in each other's company.

Another weird yet memorable location where they made love was in an old, deserted movie theater. They sneaked in after the last show, the theater's empty seats providing an unusual backdrop to their intimate moments. It was an exhilarating and romantic experience that left them both with a sense of euphoria and excitement.

Despite the unconventional settings, their love was genuine and passionate. Pixie and Rohan were deeply in sync, supporting each other's dreams and inspiring each other to grow. They attended open mic nights together, with Rohan serenading Pixie with heartfelt songs he had composed just for her.

However, as college life drew to a close, the realities of their individual paths started to weigh on their relationship. Rohan's dream of pursuing a career in music took him to a different city, while Pixie had aspirations of becoming a writer in Mumbai. The distance between them became a barrier they couldn't overcome, and with heavy hearts, they decided to part ways, cherishing the memories of their first love.

Pixie and Rohan's first love in college was a beautiful and profound experience that shaped them both in unique ways. It was a chapter in their lives that they would forever hold dear, a memory of a love that ignited their hearts and inspired their artistic souls. As they embraced their individual journeys, they carried with them the lessons learned and the warmth of a love that had touched their lives in a way they would never forget.
